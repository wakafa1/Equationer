# Equationer Project
A win32 app designed to solve linear equation with two changeable unknowns.
## Platform & Language
The project will be transformed to a multi-platform application ultimately. The elementary steps are as follows.  
1. _Delphi Project(VCL)_  
2. _C++(or maybe C#) Project(.NET Framework)_  
3. _Android Project_  
## More
The Equationer project was firstly completed by Delphi XE2 when I was in middle school. Now, in need of improving my ability of architecture, coding and transformation, I regain the project four years later.
